*  Need a lemmatizer to correctly resolve all 'node words' in the explanations
   *  Good resource : https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/lemmatization-examples-python/
   
*  Can use this to identify nodes in Q&s

  Gated Attention Networks (GaAN) (Zhang et al., 2018), 
    where gating mechanisms are inserted into the multi-head attention system of GATs, 
    in order to give different value to different headsâ€™ computations. 
    Several challenging baselines are outperformed on both 
    inductive node classification tasks (Reddit, PPI) and 
    a traffic speed forecasting task (METR-LA).
